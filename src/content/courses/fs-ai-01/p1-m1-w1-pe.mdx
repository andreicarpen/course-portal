### Your First Program: Saying Hello!

It's time to write your very first piece of code! This exercise is designed to give you a feel for the basic process: writing instructions, saving them, and telling the computer to run them. We'll keep it super simple.

**Goal:** Write a program that prints the message "Hello, World!" to the screen.

**Why "Hello, World!"?** It's a long-standing tradition in programming. It's a simple way to verify that your setup is working and you can make the computer display output.

**Steps:**

1.  **Choose Your Tool:**
    *   Open the text editor you chose in the previous lesson (we recommend VS Code, but any text editor works for now).

2.  **Write the Code:**
    *   We'll use **Python** for this first example because its syntax is very straightforward. Type the following *exactly* into your text editor:
      ```python
      print("Hello, World!")
      ```
    *   *(Optional: If you prefer JavaScript, you can use this instead:*
      ```javascript
      console.log("Hello, World!");
      ```
      *We'll cover JavaScript in much more detail later).*

3.  **Save Your File:**
    *   Go to `File > Save As...` in your editor.
    *   **Important:** Name the file `hello.py` if you wrote the Python code, or `hello.js` if you wrote the JavaScript code. The `.py` or `.js` ending tells the computer what language the file contains.
    *   Save it somewhere easy to find, like your Desktop or a dedicated folder for this course.

4.  **Run Your Code:**
    *   Now, you need to use the **Terminal** (or Command Prompt/PowerShell on Windows). Find it on your computer and open it.
    *   You'll see a text prompt. You need to tell the terminal to go to the folder where you saved your file. The command is `cd` (change directory). For example, if you saved it on your Desktop, you might type:
      ```bash
      cd Desktop
      ```
      *(Navigating in the terminal can be tricky at first! If you get stuck, search online for "how to navigate folders in terminal [your OS]".)*
    *   Once you're in the correct directory, type the command to run your file:
        *   For Python: `python hello.py`
        *   For JavaScript (requires Node.js installed, which we cover later): `node hello.js`
    *   Press Enter.

5.  **See the Result!**
    *   If everything worked, you should see the text `Hello, World!` printed directly below your command in the terminal.

**Congratulations!** You've just written and executed your first computer program. You instructed the computer to perform an action (print text), and it did exactly what you told it to do.

**Troubleshooting:**
*   **Command not found?** You might need to install Python or Node.js. We'll cover installation steps properly soon. Don't worry if it doesn't run perfectly yet.
*   **Syntax Error?** Double-check that you typed the code *exactly* as shown, including quotes and parentheses. Even small typos matter!
*   **File not found?** Make sure you are in the correct directory in the terminal using the `cd` command.

The key takeaway here is the **cycle:** Write code in an editor -> Save the file with the correct extension -> Run the file from the terminal using the language interpreter. We'll be doing this cycle countless times throughout the course!
